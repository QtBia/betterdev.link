      I never imagine that by changing SSL cert provider can reduce the bandwidth in TLS, leading to saving cost. Or just
      remove some headers does that too. They managed to save $8000/month on AWS for bandwidth by tweaking their HTTPS response.

      The essay focuses on the graph structure that underpins Git and the way the properties of this graph dictate Git’s behavior. Looking at fundamentals, you build your mental model on the truth rather than on hypotheses constructed from evidence gathered while experimenting with the API.

      Time is easy if it's static. In reality every countries has different rule and time move forward/backward. That's why people use `tzinfo` package, but a big might still happen.
      Example: 2019-09-08 is an invalid time in Chile. Go figure.

      Plaid relied on careful planning, good tooling and observability, and a healthy dose of debugging. In the end, they were able to 30x our parallelism, which equated to a cost savings of about $300k annually.

    description: |
      People seem to think that writing a garbage collector is really hard, a deep magic understood by a few great sages and Hans Boehm (et al). Well it's not. In fact, it's rather straight forward. I claim that the hardest part in writing a GC is writing the memory allocator, which is as hard to write as it is to look up the malloc example in K&R.

    description: |
      Hash tables are far more common than ordered data structures such as trees for in-memory data structures.
      1% of CPU and 4% of RAM globally at Google is used by hash tables. However, in databases, the default is almost always an ordered index, typically a B-Tree. Why so?

      You cannot easy do that because 2^32 seconds is about 100 years only. And yes, someone has this one liner magic: `i;f(){--i&&f(sleep(7));}`.
