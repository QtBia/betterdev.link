description: "Hi all, DST began yesterday at 2:00AM local time. I'm sure many developers/sysadmins had to do some migration to move time over for the system, or solve some bugs around this. I'd guess many tests failed too! That's fine, we are always learning. I hope by reading this newsletter we can learn more about edge cases of programming, the fast evolution of technologies, or a new JavaScript framework everyday. Good news: we get more daylight to read now :). Have a good week everyone!"
