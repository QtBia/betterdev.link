      Wrong order of argument is a comment mistake. If we just rely on simple
      type such as `int` it may not enough to help discover the bug since
      they mey all int. However, by wrapping them in a value class we can
      spot the error sooner. The post is in Scale but they are applied to
      any language

      You can write the GUI side of the application in Dart (instead of one for
      Android, one for iOS), and the "back-end" mostly in Go (rather than
      duplicate the logic in Java/Kotlin and Objective-C/Swift), with only a
      thin glue-code layer written in the platform's native language (in our
      case, Kotlin on Android, Swift on iOS).
