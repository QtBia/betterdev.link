description: "Hi everyone, hope you all had a great weekend. This week, I'm adding something new, aiming at making us a better developer: 'Code to Read' and 'Tools'. If you have any recommendations, please reply to this email. Also, if you learn anything from our links and come up with some code or some articles you'd like to share, please let me know too. I'll share with our readers in next issue."

    description: "Several people at React Conf asked me for advice on becoming a better programmer. For some reason, people see me as a pretty advanced programmer worth listening to. I thought it would be worthwhile to write down my \"mental model\" for how I have approached programming over the years."

    title: How To Write Your Own Virtual DOM
    description: "There are two things you need to know to build your own Virtual DOM. You do not even need to dive into React’s source or into the source code of any other Virtual DOM implementations. They are so large and complex — but in reality the main part of Virtual DOM can be written in less than 50 lines of code… 50. Lines. Of. Code!!!"

    title: "Does BEM Work?"
    description: "BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a component-based approach to web development. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development fast and easy even with a complex UI, and it allows the reuse of existing code without copying and pasting. But does it work? For the author of article, it does."

    title: "You Do Not Need A CSS Grid Based Grid System"
    description: "In the last couple of weeks I have started to see CSS Grid layout-based frameworks and grid systems appearing. I’m actually surprised as to how long it has taken, but I am yet to see one that adds any value at all over just using CSS Grid Layout."

    title: "Why Go Interfaces Are Awesome"
    description: "You don’t have to declare that a Go type (which can be used kind of like a “class” in other languages) implements an interface, like you do in C# or Java. You just declare the interface, and then any type that happens to have those methods can be used anywhere that interface is required."

    description: "I'll start with some context and background about Constructor functions and the class keyword, then I will explain exactly what the `new` keyword is doing under the hood. Next, I will show how it does what it does by implementing it in code. Finally, I will explain why it does these things and give a couple arguments for avoiding this approach to JavaScript object creation altogether in most situations."

    title: "The Importance Of Microdecisions"
    description: "When writing code, we have to make many small decisions when a problem can be solved in different ways. The author thinks that the teeny tiny decisions that don't really matter are actually some of the most important ones. If there are no reasons to choose one version over another, take the time to find a reason to pick one."
