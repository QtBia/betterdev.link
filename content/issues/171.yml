      Event Loop is a leak abstraction. It forces us to understand is charactert to right well perform application. It's the primary primitive browser allows to write code that won't cause blocking behaviour.

      FixedArray and FixedDoubleArray are used to create objects in JavaScript, and although the new implementations looked valid at first glance, they were missing a key component: a maximum length check to ensure that the newly created array’s length cannot not go past a predefined upper limit.
      To the untrained eye, this bug does not look exploitable, but as shown on the bug report, Sergey made use of TurboFan’s typer to gain access to a very powerful exploitation primitive: an array whose length field is much larger than its capacity. This primitive provides an attacker with an out-of-bounds access primitive on the V8 heap, which can very easily lead to code execution

      HOT stand for  “Heap Only Tuple”. It is a feature that overcomes some of the inefficiencies of how PostgreSQL handles UPDATEs.
      An update adds a new row version call tuple. In other words, update is like delete followed by an insert. Essentially, UPDATE-heavy workloads are challenging for PostgreSQL. This is the area where HOT updates help.

      Network is the backbone of almost any cloud application. When companies scale, we add more network, qa, staging, prod, support, rds, elasticache and eventually we need to allow those network to communicate with each others.
      How to manage that complexity? Adding a new network and allow traffic flow require you to add a new route table. A single bad route can cause lost traffic? Let's learn how Slack manage that complexity
