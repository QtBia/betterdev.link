    title: "A few thoughts on the $80 million fine from the Capital One Breach"
    description: "It's Twitter thread so a bit hard to read but worth it. The cause is due to an AWS IAM policy `s3:GetObject` to `*` resource. IAM is trial and error, you run your app, see if it works and need what permission and grant it. Sometime you feel frustrated and just quickly do a `*` and there we go. $80 million fine. What can we do about it? This thread give some tips and guide line to improve security when working with IAM. Some tools such as [police sentry](https://github.com/salesforce/policy_sentry/) to review IAM, or [Netflix's repokid](https://github.com/Netflix/repokid) to automatically revoking unused IAM permission."

      Compare two tables in great way to verify something like ETL job, backup, replication. The normal method is `table1 - table2 union table2 - table1` but that fetch each tables 2 times? How can we do that with a single fetch per table?

      Have feel frustrated because you have a SSH session that disconnect/timeout somehow when returning to your laptop? Most of the time I ended up just close my terminal. But it has a way to do that properly. Basically, to force terminate a frozen SSH session, press `~` then `.`. Note that when press `~` nothing will show up on terminal though.
