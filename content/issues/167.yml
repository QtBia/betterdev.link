    description: |
      This book was created by WebRTC implementers to share their hard-earned knowledge with the world. WebRTC for the curious is an Open Source book written for those that are always looking for more. This book doesn’t settle for abstraction.

    title: "Tuning Postgresql AutoVacuum"
    description: |
      In many PostgreSQL databases, you never have to think or worry about tuning autovacuum. It runs automatically in the background and cleans up without getting in your way.
      But sometimes the default configuration is not good enough, and you have to tune autovacuum to make it work properly. This article presents some typical problem scenarios and describes what to do in these cases.
      I encounters a lot of vacuuming issue when making many data deletions.

    title: "How to turn an ordinary gzip archive into a database"
    description: |
      This article demonstrates how specially crafted but ordinary gzip archives can be used as a database like storage.
      The ideal is to sort the source files then gzip. When everything is combined, the complete search system takes less than 0.3 seconds to search in the 1TB of compressed data.
      It also introduces a Python package and explains how it works, but the idea is sound and we can implement it in any language.

    title: Constant Time LFU
    description: |
      A common strategy to make any system super-performant is Caching. Eventually the cache memory grows and we need to evict data to reclaim memory. Two algorithms to pick what to evict is LFU and LRU.
      In this essay, we take a look at Constant Time LFU implementation based on the paper An O(1) algorithm for implementing the LFU cache eviction scheme by Prof. Ketan Shah, Anirban Mitra and Dhruv Matani, where instead of using a min-heap, it uses a combination of doubly-linked lists and hash table to gain a running time complexity of O(1) for all the three core operations.

    title: "The log/event processing pipeline you can't have"
    description: |
      Thoughts on design/implementation of a log pipeline system which aims to be simple and cheap. To quote the author: You can probably find, somewhere, something similar to each of the components I'm going to talk about, but you probably can't find a single solution that combines it all with good performance and super-low latency for a reasonable price.

      Get started with WebAssembly through  a simple hands-on tutorial that assumes only general knowledge in web development. The only tools you’ll need to get a taste of Wasm through runnable code examples are a code editor, any modern browser, and a Docker container with toolchains for C and Rust that comes with the article.

    title: "Why are true and false so large?"
    description: |
      true and false are built-in shell function, but apparently, we have `true` and `false` as binary executable files in `/usr/bin`. Their jobs are just to exit with code `0` or `1`. So the billion dollar question: why they are big?

      Facebook built Shard Manager as a generic platform that facilitates efficient development and operation of reliable sharded applications, instead of each app/team manage their own way of sharding.

This is another attempt. Ruby safe navigator `&.` or Rust's `?` or examples of Monads. Another old read on Monad is [You Could Have Invented Monads! (And Maybe You Already Have.)](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monads-and.html), written by a 3 times Oscar winner."
