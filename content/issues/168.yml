    title: "The Life of a Data Byte: Be kind and rewind"
    description: "A byte of data has been stored in a number of different ways through the years as newer, better, and faster storage media are introduced. A byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly refers to eight bits. A bit is a unit of information that can be expressed as 0 or 1, representing a logical state. Let's take a brief walk down memory lane to learn about the origins of bits and bytes."

    description: "On AWS, tagging is a way to categorize resources for many reasons: billing analysis, grant permission. Examples of tag usages: this user can only access resources with this tag, or automated backup EBS volume with this tag. AWS is massive and if we don’t tag, we will very quickly end up with a big mess."

      Basecamp, the maker of Ruby On Rails, suffered a few major outages this month and share the post mortem. I always love these posts because why we can learn from success, learning from failure is even more important because not many share their failure :-). An interesting part is that the chatops server that can be used to reconfigure the network is down/slow due to network being overload and they have to manually reconfigure the routers.

    title: "What Shell Am I Using?"
    description: |
      Finding the shell you're actually using isn't all that simple at first. You can find the location of the executable of the shell. You can find all the processes currently running with that shell name. But gathering information about the shell you're typing all those commands in to find the shell you're using requires a little more poking around. The two easiest solutions, on macOS at least, are lsof and fuser

    description: |
      In order to see what the who command is doing I could try to find the source code and dig into it. But I found it fun to use strace to check what the process was doing instead. Since we are expecting who to read system files, we can only focus on the open syscalls.
