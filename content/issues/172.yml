  Hi everyone, Welcome to issue #172.

  This week, I want to introduce [starship](https://starship.rs) again. We linked to it in issue 119. But recently my zsh prompt is too slow. I do want to have all information like git repo, kube context, cli version etc but the prompt from my zsh theme is crazy slow. Take a few seconds to show up. Switching to starship make it run way faster. You also deal with nice config language instead of shell :-).

    title: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Compression
    description: |
      We used compression everyday, tar, gzip, zip. What is the exact algorithm to power them?
      Today, much of the relevant work to compression is in an obscure corner of the internet between lengthy PhD thesis papers and hard-to-find gems.
      Let's dig in.

      Eventually any large scale website will have to deal with bot, crawler, who usually just consume your resource without bringing any benefit. How we prevent them?
      HAProxy may not well-know like Nginx because it only do load balancing, cannot do static file servers like Nginx. But it's do its job very well and support many primitives for advanced load balancing such as rate limiting, which helpful when dealing with bot.

      This talk is designed for PostgreSQL administrators.  It covers all aspects of PostgreSQL administration, including installation, security, file structure, configuration, reporting, backup, daily maintenance, monitoring activity, disk space computations, and disaster recovery.  It shows how to control host connectivity, configure the server, find the query being run by each session, and find the disk space used by each database.

    title: "Coping with the TCP TIME-WAIT state on busy Linux server"
    description: |
      The Linux TCP stack is a finite state machine. So when closing a connection, 2 sides need to coordinate so the state can be advanced.
      TIME-WAIT is when the local server close the connection already, the connection is kept around so that any delayed packets can be matched to the connection and handled appropriately. Also it makes sure the remote side know that the connection is closed, so it's closed as well otherwise it stuck in LAST-ACK state. And it exit this state in 4 minutes.
      Needless to say, keeping these around on a busy server is expensive, you need CPU, memory to handle them.

    description: |
      Writing DNS server is like hello world for networking to me. DNS is small enough, not massive like HTTP, also relying on UDP, so I think it's a good exercise to learn UDP, DNS protocol.
      This artcile is focus on Rust, and I'm not a Rust programmer, only toy with Rust and I was able to follow it.
