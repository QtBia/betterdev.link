  Thing I dont know as of 2018 and crypto101

draft: false

description: |
  Happy new year every one. Thank you for being a reader.
  2018 is a crazy years, we saw the up and down of cryptocurrency. WebAssembly started to become
  real. Kubernetes is defenitely the tool of DevOps. Vue is picking up on React...I'm sure that
  we sometimes feel we are in a hopeless race to catch up with the shiny new things. It's frustrated.
  Dan, creator of Redux and contributor of React, wrote a blog post to reflect on thing he doesn't know
  as of 2018. That means, even a profilic developer has thing they don't know. However, they look up and
  learn it when they need. So be relax, focus on the main thing that you are interested, and pickup
  on side things as a fun activity rather to keep catching up with trend.

      Postgres extensions are usually in C/C++. I have linked a lot to a Rust links about projects that enable us to
      write Rust in place of C/C++ before. I think Rust is a great, more approach language for these kind of integration.
