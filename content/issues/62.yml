  Hi all, This week [homebrew is hack](https://medium.com/@vesirin/how-i-gained-commit-access-to-homebrew-in-30-minutes-2ae314df03ab) because a writeable GitHub api token is stored in a public readable Jenkins. It's so important to get the basic security right, so I include quite a bit of DevOps, best practice for production, security tools in this issue.

      A few months ago the NSA released LemonGraph, a graph database based on LMDB. Ayende read the code in lexical order, and mostly trying to figure out where things are happening and what the code is doing. It's very interesting to see how expert explore a new codebase.

      The art of managing systems at scale lies in embracing failure and being at the edge — pushing the limits of your system and software performance ‘almost’ to breaking point, yet still being able to recover.

    description: |
       The main hypothesis is that we should be able to prevent access to specific rows of data based on a policy. That means our application logic only has to worry about SELECT * FROM my_table and RLS will handle the WHERE user_id = my_user_id part automagically.

    description: |
      WPA-2 (802.11i) has some fundamental security problems, and these have thus led to the creation of WPA-3. A core problem is around the 4-way handshake, and here is me cracking WPA-2 by listening to the handshake with just a Raspberry PI and a $10 wi-fi transceiver

      As always, I like the article of real-world scaling. This is how CoinBase scale their infrastructure
      by keep upgrading to new version, build better tooling to identify the bottle neck, capture and replay traffic.
      The issue of user-device many to many relationship is interesting too.
