   I think many progammers dream building their own game or programming language. We sure love to build tool.
   Tim Morgan did that. He followed another project call [Mal](https://github.com/kanaka/mal), which we linked to before to make a Lisp interpreter. Once learn enough, Tim think that if they could make a List interpreter, they could probably repeat to make a compiler for Mal. Tim achived their goal and encourage us to do same.
