      On a large enough project, you’ll eventually bump into code that you
      don’t understand. The only way to understand is by run and debug it.

      How on earth would you make a useful program without using an if statement?
      Do you remember that heavily nested code you had to understand last week?
      Let’s look at the problem that if statements pose and pattern we can use
      to repalce if.

    description: |
      Bash is almost everywhere, together with Linux utilities make it shine
      when we want to wire thing together. But Bash is not a language where the
      correct way to do something is also the easiest. If there is anything like
      a driver's license for safe bash coding, it must be rule zero of
      BashPitfalls: Always use quotes

    description: |
      Deprecating APIs seems easy — issue warning on old method call, suggest
      new usage. Then use `sed` to replac all :D. This works for simple method
      call. How can we make it better? Write Ruby code that re-write your Ruby
      code.

      Dataviz is a library that helps to build and understand standard data
      structures with added visualizations developed by Graphviz. It’s
      supplemented with many examples to help you learn and visualize how data
      structures work.

    description: |
      There are about six major of memory models. Three derive from languages of
      the 1950s — COBOL, LISP, and FORTRAN — and the other three derive from the
      three historically important data storage systems: magnetic tape,
      Unix-style hierarchical filesystems, and relational databases.

      Any migration has a higher risks than other code change, especilly network
      provider. This blog post layout a strategy to build out a test framework
      and use it as a way to assert the new system is good and strategy for
      cut-over.

      We're going to explore the problem space, generate multiple solutions for
      our design decisions, compare those solutions to understand the tradeoffs
      between them, and finally choose the right solution for our system.

      Despite replacing all human heuristics, AlphaGoZero still uses tree search
      algorithms at its core. I hope to convince you that AlphaGoZero’s success
      is as much due to this algorithm as it is due to machine learning.
