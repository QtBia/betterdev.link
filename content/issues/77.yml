      Data is stored by the charge (or lack of it) on a tiny capacitor within the RAM chip.
      These capacitors lose their charge over time, mean losing data. We need to refresh
      to restore the charge. RAM is blocked when this occurs. So how often this happen? Yes,
      every 7.8μs

      Fiber is the newest implementation of change dectection.
      Besides solving real problems of application developers, the internal implementation of these mechanisms has a wide appeal from the engineering perspective. There’s such a wealth of knowledge in the sources that will help us grow as developers.

      When we need to visualize a large array with low-profile hardware, say 500,000 data points in a single render pass.
      We need to cheat by drawing each vertical pixel column as one line reaching from the minimum sample to the maximum sample
      instead of individual points.
