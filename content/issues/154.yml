    title: "Everything you should know about certificates and PKI but are too afraid to ask"
    description: "X.509, ASN.1, OIDs, DER, PEM, PKCS, oh my...I was too embarrassed to ask questions so I never learned. Certificates are the best way to identify code and devices, and identity is super useful for security, monitoring, metrics, and a million other things. Using certificates is not that hard. No harder than learning a new language or database. It's just slightly annoying and poorly documented"

      A look at how Slack setup development environment. They actually use cloud for dev environment instead of running them on developer laptop
      because the Slack app is too complicated and they try to mimick production as much as possible.

    description: "ECC is the next generation of public key cryptography, and based on currently understood mathematics, it provides a significantly more secure foundation than first-generation public key cryptography systems like RSA. If you're worried about ensuring the highest level of security while maintaining performance, ECC makes sense to adopt.

    description: |
      diffs are central to version control like Git. Once you’ve found a difference between two files, how would you find the next line in each version where the text matches up again? It’s more complicated than it looks! And different algorithms can even produce different difference result too.

    description: |
      The execution time as reported by EXPLAIN ANALYZE is substantially higher than that of the real query execution time.
      Turn out the measurement overhead added by EXPLAIN ANALYZE can be significant, especially on machines with slow gettimeofday() operating-system calls.
      So on system use KVM where click is as fast as hypervisor’s, the EXPLAIN ANALYZE looks faster than one from XEN which uses virtualized clock for VMs.

      To do long addition we sum right to left, if result is greater than 10, we carry 1 to its left.
      The assembly code have extra instruction to hold that carry, if we can eliminate it, then our generated assembly code
      has less thing to do. How can we do that?

      One may describe their sock product as a “woolen long sock,” whereas another may have a similar sock product described as a “blue striped long sock.”
      A detail look at how Shopify with more than 1M business owners, build a machine learning model to category this. They leverage Google Product Taxonomy (GPT)
      which is a list that over 5000 categories and is hierarchical for a set of categories that represents all the products in the commerce space.

    description: |
      If you are writing an application in Javascript, soon you will have to worry about memory leaks. But it is difficult to even know if a memory leak exists. This handy method can help.
      Someone also share a [few scripts to detect memory leak using chrome devtools protocol](https://gist.github.com/connorjclark/549fa524a0b8fdc8bbb1b48e1dc86419). Pretty slick, check its out as well

    description: |
      Explain how to setup a CUPS network printing server on an ARM-Linux which will still be able to use older or discontinued printer drivers, meant for other architectures, using Docker with Qemu platform emulation. Therefore we could use for example 32bit Linux printer drivers emulated inside the container on our ARM server

      This talk will explain how to work with elliptic curves constructively to obtain secure and efficient implementations, and will highlight pitfalls that must be avoided when implementing elliptic-curve crypto (ECC). The talk will also explain what all the buzz in curve choices for TLS is about. This talk does not require any prior exposure to ECC.
