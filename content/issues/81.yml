      Java is fast because of JIT, same for V8. If you ever worry what is JIT? Then at the end of the day, it
      just they generate machine code directly. Usually they did that after a code path is execute over a threshold.
      The most difficult part of writing a simple JIT is encoding the instructions so they can be understood by your target CPU.

       Let’s say you have nn files of roughly the same size, and you want to guard against mm of them being lost or corrupted. To do so, you generate mm parity files ahead of time, and if in the future you lose up to mm of the data files, you can use an equal number of parity files to recover the lost data files.
