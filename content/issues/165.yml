    description: |
      The more I used the computer, the more I realize we all have different workflow and habit, yet I used a pre-built keyboard. I know Chefs that like to have their own custom build knives, I would like to build my own keyborad, custom to what I need, write my own firmware for it. This is a serie with 5 articles.

    description: |
      Distributed systems provide a particular challenge to program. They often require us to have multiple copies of data, which need to keep synchronized.
      This article recognizes and develops these solutions as patterns, with which we can build up an understanding of how to better understand, communicate and teach distributed system design.

    title: Entropy Explained, With Sheep
    description: |
      Sometime on Linux when you are generating password, it said something like generating entropy, or not enough entropy. Entropy is a key of randomess. In this we will learn about them
      from a different angel, using sheep to help visualize them for easily understanding.

    description: |
      Time to time I want to have a table with fast write and I'm ok if I lost data of that table, I don't want it to be corrupted(such as violation constraint) but losing data of that table
      if database is restarted is ok, then unlogger table is an option. It skips write ahead log.

      There is no doubt WikiMedia receives a massive amount of traffic. The awesome of making change and see it reflect immediately at that scale are amazing.
      This article describe two major changes to their infrastructure. Firstly, servers that used to be fronted by LVS for load balancing are now peering directly with our routers. Secondly, we have started using IP anycast for a highly critical service: recursive DNS.

      The Linux TCP stack has a myriad of sysctl knobs that allow to change its behavior.  This includes the amount of memory that can be used for receive or transmit operations, the maximum number of sockets and optional features and protocol extensions.

    title: "lethe: a tunnable delete-aware LSM engine"
    description: |
      LSM is famous for MyRock, LevelDB, Cassandra. LSM-trees write the incoming key-value entries in an in-memory buffer to ensure high write throughput, and uses in-memory auxiliary data structures (such as Bloom filters and fence pointers) to provide competitive read performance. While LSMs are great for writes and reads in general, we show that all state-of-the-art LSM-based data stores perform suboptimally in presence deletes in a workload

This articile is about a quick hack that create a temp table and set up a periodically job to get metric from `pg_stat_statements` and insert into that table. Then analyzing that tabel to find slow query

#      Writing DNS server is like hello world for networking to me. DNS is small enough, not massive like HTTP, also relying on UDP, so I think it's a good exercise to learn UDP, DNS protocol.
#      This artcile is focus on Rust, and I'm not a Rust programmer, only toy with Rust and I was able to follow it.
