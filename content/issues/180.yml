      It was at this point where we had a decision to make. We had, at best, five months of runway left on our activity_id column before the rollover happened. Yet no alternative data store really was meeting all our requirements.

    description: "The goal of this was to indirectly infer the state of the application without introducing measurable overhead. I've run a few hundred hours of benchmarks and collected over one million data points to make sure my analysis was correct. Eventually, I plan to write about all aspects of my research, but today we will focus on a metric that has already been added to Node."
