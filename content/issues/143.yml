  Hi everyone! üëã

  Welcome to issue #143. This week I'm sure everyone know of Covid-19 now. Please stay home, try
  to not going out to publish as much as possible. Many companies encourages work from home, so less
  comute time, more time to learn. Stay safe and hope this will get over quickly.

  This week, I want to share this tip. I was always wondering how `#!` work in script, how does Linux
  know to invoke Bash/Python/Ruby when we write `#!/bin/bash` or `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`. Turn out, Linux use 
  `exec()` syscall to run the script. `exec()` knows how to load the program to execute the script by parsing
  `#!`. Here is the [Linux FAQ of `#!`](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/faq/part3/section-16.html) and a post 
  about [#!magic](https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/)

    title: "Mass account takeovers using HTTP Request Smuggling on https://slackb.com/ to steal session cookies"
    description: |
      A very interesting security issue on Slack app. It exploited an HTTP Request Smuggling bug on a Slack asset to perform a CL.TE-based hijack onto neighboring customer requests.
      You can read more about [request smuggling](https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn) and [http desync attachks](https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-what-happened-next).
      If you are using Nginx, your app maybe vulnerable to similar issue. If you are behind AWS Load Balancer or Cloudfront, they already protected you from this.

      Have you ever though of digging into Google Chrome code to find bug?
      It sounds scary. Smart people work on browser engines. But at the end of day,
      it is just code, and you can understand how it works.
      The author found some issue by doing steps like fuzzing, a lot of debugging. If they
      went to source code, they may found bug sooner.

    description: |
      a basic search module that you can add to a static website. It's very lightweight (50kB-100kB gzipped) and should work with Hugo, Zola, and Jekyll.
      The engine is written in Rust, compile to webassembly using wasm-pack, which also auto-generate the JavaScript code to talk to Wasm.
      Now, it is time to move further away from JavaScript :-) if you didn't like it.

      In this series we'll write a rudimentary database from scratch in Go.
      We will build a parser, a in-memory engine to query/insert data.
      Interesting see how we can build a simple SQL engine in such as small amount of code.
      Even if you don't write Go, it is still worth your read to see how the parser is implemented.
