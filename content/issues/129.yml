  Hi all, this week I want to share this cool book: [https://sql-performance-explained.com/](https://sql-performance-explained.com/).
  You can use discount code `CyberMon19` to get the PDF for free. The author has temporarily made his fabulous SQL performance book
  available for free for a few days.

  Now to our links. If you like this newsletter, please forward it to your friends :-).

    title: "UUIDs are Popular, but Bad for Performance"
    description: |
      In order to appreciate the impact of using UUID values as a primary key, it is important to review how InnoDB organizes the data. InnoDB stores the rows of a table in the b-tree of the primary key. In database terminology, we call this a clustered index. The clustered index orders the rows automatically by the primary key.

      You’re making morning drip coffee. You need to make 2 cups. Do you:
        1. Put 1 cups worth of water in the boiler so the water boils sooner and the first cup is ready sooner or,
        2. Put 2 cups worth of water in so both cups are done sooner?
      This is an illustration of Latency/Throughput.

      This paper has two major purposes. The first is to define some of the terms and concepts behind basic cryptographic methods, and to offer a way to compare the myriad cryptographic schemes in use today. The second is to provide some real examples of cryptography in use today. (See Section A.4 for some additional commentary on this...)

    description: |
      Mergeable Replicated Data Types (MRDTs) are in the same spirit as CRDTs but with the very interesting property that they compose. Furthermore, a principled approach for deriving MRDTs is provided, allowing a wide range of data-types to be lifted to their mergeable, replicated counterparts with very little effort on the part of the programmer.
