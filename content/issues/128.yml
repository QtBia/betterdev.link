  This week I want to share this small tip. On Mac, to show hidden file(dot files) in Finder you can simply type `CMD + SHIFT + .`.
  To permanently applied this, you can change default config by running this command from terminal `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES`.
  You will need to force restart finder to have it effective by killing finder.

      The goal of this research was to try and see if websites hosted on Bluehost, Dreamhost, HostGator, OVH, or iPage could be compromised with one click client-side vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, we found at least one client-side vulnerability in all the platforms we tested, allowing account takeover when the victim clicks a link or visits a malicious website.

      Make was born in 1976, making it one of the oldest tools in a programmer’s toolkit. Any tool that has been around this long is bound to have a mythology, stories, and examples that would be intimidating to someone unfamiliar with it. Additionally, I think many of us have written it off as no longer relevant, as we are not writing C programs, after all. Allow me to show you why it should not be intimidating, and furthermore, is applicable to your everyday workflow as an engineer.

    description: "Latency has long been synomonous with mobile networking. Though progress has been made in recent years, the reductions to network latency have not kept pace with the increases in speed. As a consequence of this disparity, it is latency, not throughput, that is most often the factor limiting the performance of network transactions."
