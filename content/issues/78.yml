    description: |
      a collaborative effort to create a guide for all important algorithms in all languages.
      This project is essentially a book about algorithms collaboratively written by an online community.
      Data Structure, Math, Sorting, Tree traversal...all are there for you to consolidate your knowledge.

      Acolyer review a paper call: "Overload Control for Scaling WeChat Microservices". It's great because
      we got insight into the backend that powers WeChat; and secondly the authors share the design of the battle hardened overload control system DAGOR that has been in production at WeChat for five years.

    title: "Why is 2 * (i * i) faster than 2 * i * i in Java?"
    description: |
      Simple question. Great answer. Due to different generated bytecode. I don't use Java but found a great
      explanation from it.

    description: |
      The JVM is well-know for cold start because enough iteration has to be executed so it will compile bytecode to
      native code for better performance. This slowness cause issue before the code path are consider hot. This article
      includes strategy to warm up before putting service under real traffic by replaying logs to warm itself.

      Microservices seems to have become the de facto standard. And it‚Äôs understandable, given the promises that come with: resiliency, HA, low coupling, agility. However, some started to re-consider them. This post will go about

    description: |
      UUIDs are a popular identifier data type ‚Äì they are unpredictable, and/or globally unique (or at least very unlikely to collide) and quite easy to generate. Traditional primary keys based on sequences won‚Äôt give you any of that, which makes them unsuitable for public identifiers, and UUIDs solve that pretty naturally
