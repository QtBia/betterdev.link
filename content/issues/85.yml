    description: |
      PagerDuty makes softwate to do on-call, mean they have to think deeply about incident response.
      They shares their internal process and from what I gather, these are the real practice they really doing
      now.

      Radix tree is commonly used in HTTP routing. They are very efficient to be used
      when the data you store may share a commont prefix such as HTTP route, IP. Armon, CTO
      of Hashicorpt, wrote about [readix tress transaction and memdb](https://speakerdeck.com/armon/radix-trees-transactions-and-memdb)

      We linked to this series a few time in past. Basically the author is building an OS
      in Rust. This post introduces paging, a very common memory management scheme that we
      will also use for our operating system. It explains why memory isolation is needed, how segmentation works, what virtual memory is,
      and how paging solves memory fragmentation issues.

      You can use emoji (and other graphical unicode characters) in URLs.
      What if we dynamically change URL with emoji(without reloading the page) to create cool effect.
      You may never used this in real life but it's super fun to read this post.

      RocksDB are being used in many application in place of SQLite, or as a storage engine to build some abstraction on top of it.
      It's being use to replace for MySQL storage engine, used in Kafka, in Queue System. This post CockrachLab shares why
      the rich feature sets of RocksDB help them build CockroachDB.
