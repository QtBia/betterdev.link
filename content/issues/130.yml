  During Chrismats season, as a tradition, a few sites on internet dedicated to one article per day till christmas.
  They are usually very interesting, short and to the point. One example is: [Iteration without for, foreach or while](https://functional.christmas/2019/7).
  You should checkout [https://security.christmas/](https://security.christmas/) too.  [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/) is another site of this kind, one interesting programming challenger per day till christmas.

    description: "Garbage collector is an important component of languages like Python, Java, Ruby, JavaScript where we don't have to manually manage memory.
