    description: |
      Given the petabyte scale size and criticality of data, we need a robust and efficient backup and restore solution. We drastically reduced our Recovery Time Objective (RTO) to under 30 minutes by redesigning our tooling to use disk-based snapshots, and we want to share how it was done
