    description: |
      Raytracing is a relatively simple way to render images of 3D objects. The core is an elegant idea, that one can simulate the real-world behavior of photons of light bouncing off of surfaces and colors accumulating from their paths. It's not inherently fast, but the simplicity of the core lets it model interesting things like reflections and depth of field in ways that mirror natural processes.

    description: |
      This paper proposes an efficient tree data structure that relies on splitting variable length keys into a variable number of fixed-length keys called slices. As you go down the tree, you compare the first slice of each key, then the second, then the third and so on, but each comparision has constant cost.

      Part of Graph Databases for Beginners blog series by Neo4J. This post discuss different graph search algorithms and how they’re used, including Dijkstra’s algorithm and the A* algorithm. Our discussion will focus on what graph search algorithms do for you (and your business) without diving too deep into the mathematics of graph theory.

    description: |
      Microservices architecture (MSA) has become very popular. However, one common problem is how to manage distributed transactions across multiple microservices. This post is going to share my experience from past projects and explain the problem and possible patterns that could solve it.

      Automated tests always act as a good bug report when they fail. What information a good bug report needs. There are 5 questions every unit test must answer: what is tested, what it does, the actual output, expected output and how to re-produce.

    description: |
      On my laptop, I got up to 70 million goroutines before I got bored. So why can you have so many more Goroutines than threads? The answer is a fun journey down the operating system and back up again.

    description: |
      This is a beginner level article, so I will not spell out every detail.
      This memory allocator will not be fast and efficient, we will not adjust allocated memory to align to a page boundary, but we will build a memory allocator that works. That’s it.

    title: "What's a CPU to do when it has nothing to do"
    description: |
      It would be reasonable to expect doing nothing to be an easy, simple task for a kernel, but it isn't.
      At Kernel Recipes 2018, Rafael Wysocki discussed what CPUs do when they don't have anything to do, how the kernel handles this
      The idle loop, one of the kernel subsystems that Wysocki maintains, controls what a CPU does when it has no processes to run

      Have ever feel frustrated because you don't understand the network layer? what
      are layer4, layer7 or layer2/3 routing? What kind of data is in a TCP packet?
      What is exactly happen during a TLS handshake?
      All of these requires some fundamental knowledges and cannot answer in a short post.
