    title: "Dynamic Programming – From Novice to Advanced"
    description: "Recursion is widely used in solving problems at first approach becuase they're easy to come up. However, some computations may occur multiple times, leads to inefficient and stack overflow. Dynamic programming is a technique that attempt to solve a sub set of problems, then using that knowledge to build up result for large problem until reach the final result. Usually, when we are using recursion to solve a problem, we can apply dynamic programming to solve that problem in a more efficient way."

    title: "A brief introduction to tries"
    description: "Trie is a kind of search tree. It's commonly used for storing and searching single characters that make up one or more strings. Some usecases are in routing layer of a web framework, to see which IP address belong to a class. This article gives some brief introductuon to trie. Hope you can find more places to apply it after this."

    description: "Now that you are familiar with a trie. Let's look into its real life usage. When you connect to a network, your computer has to deal with ip routing. It's process of figure out where to send the IP package to for the communication between you computer and other computer or device on network. On Linux, with its implementation of IPv4 routing tables using LPC-tries, Linux offers good lookup performance (50 ns for a full view) and low memory usage (64 MiB for a full view)."

    description: "Backend developers often has a hard time when coming to design their own project. Hence, We opt for minimal design. But we still have to answer the question of how much space between elements? Which colors to use? This guide is very well suited to made these decision better without investing deeply into design field."

    description: "Lots of open source icon projects comes after each other. So what is the best icon? The answer may be just a text label. When we limited out choice on thing we don't master, it helps to make a good enough decision. If you're building your own side project, and want to find a perfect icon for a while, then it maybe a text label."

    description: "Last month CloudFlare shared statistics on some popular reflection attacks. Back then, the largest SSDP they record was: 30 Mpps (millions of packets per second), 80 Gbps (billions of bits per second), using 940k reflector IPs. Then recently they noticed  an unusually large SSDP amplification, it crossed the symbolic threshold of 100 Gbps. Beside the information, we can also learn about the method and tool they use to analyze the attack"

    description: "Python is a great programming language for crunching data and automating repetitive tasks. Got a few gigs of web server logs to process or a million images that need resizing? No problem! You can almost always find a helpful Python library that makes the job easy. But while Python makes coding fun, it’s not always the quickest to run. Let’s learn how to take advantage of the full processing power of your computer by running Python functions in parallel."

    title: Container isolation gone wrong
    description: "Docker is still trending right now. One of the main advantages of embracing containers is “lightweight virtualization”. Since each container is just a thin layer around the containerized processes, The user gains enormous efficiencies, for example by increasing the container density per host, or by spinning containers up and down at a very fast pace."
