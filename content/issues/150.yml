    title: "The Best Medium-Hard Data Analyst SQL Interview Questions"
    description: |
      The first 70% of SQL is pretty straightforward but the remaining 30% can be pretty tricky.
      Working through this guide should improve your performance on data analyst interviews.
      It should also make you better at your current and future job positions. Personally, I find some of the SQL patterns found in this doc useful for ETLs powering reporting tools featuring trends over time.

      This series explains concepts that are fundamental to deep learning and artificial neural networks for beginners. In addition to covering these concepts, we also show how to implement some of the concepts in code using Keras, a neural network API written in Python.
      This site also has a bunch of free courses on Deep Learning. You can check them out under Courses menu. The best is they are all free.

    title: "How does a tcp reset attack work"
    description: |
      A TCP reset attack is executed using a single packet of data, no more than a few bytes in size. A spoofed TCP segment, crafted and sent by an attacker, tricks two victims into abandoning a TCP connection, interrupting possibly vital communications between them.
      The attack is believed to be a key component of China‚Äôs Great Firewall, used by the Chinese government to censor the internet inside China. Despite this weighty biography, understanding the attack doesn‚Äôt require deep prior knowledge of networking or TCP.

      It reads like a sale pitch for Segment, but it's pretty good. They need to forward analytic event to many providers such as
      google, mixpanel, saleforce .Queue isn't a good option when the job is fan out
      data to third party. The queue which only has push/pop action may block entire queue when third party is down. Some very good
      design there to handle retry, avoid back pressure block the queue.

      Not much on systemd but more focus on SystemTap,  diagnostic tool for instrumenting and inspecting parts of Linux that traditional tools cannot reach. Among other things, SystemTap allows you to place probes in a kernel module that will fire when particular functions run. From there, you can query the function parameters or the return value and walk the stack or display a stack trace.
