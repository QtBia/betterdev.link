  Hi everyone,

  The world continue to need video chat software that secure and reliable. WebRTC is utilized a lot to quickly build your own tool. In this issue, I had
  2 code bases that to help you learn about building video call apps with WebRTC.

  I also found this great resource: Freecodecamp is offering free course for AWS certificate, available on their youtube channel, for free and no advertisements. [Check them out](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/pass-the-aws-developer-associate-exam-with-this-free-16-hour-course/).

    description: |
      A decade after Doom‚Äôs release, in 2003, journalist David Kushner published a book about id Software called Masters of Doom, which has since become the canonical account of Doom‚Äôs creation.
      Carmack, realizing the problem with his renderer was fundamental enough that he would need to find a better rendering algorithm, started reading research papers. He eventually implemented a technique called ‚Äúbinary space partitioning,‚Äù never before used in a video game, that dramatically sped up the Doom engine.

    description: |
      Hubspot migrated hundreds of ZooKeeper instances from individual server instances to Kubernetes without downtime.
      Their approach used powerful Kubernetes features like endpoints to ease the process, so we‚Äôre sharing the high level outline of the approach for anyone who wants to follow in our footsteps.

    description: |
      Slack‚Äôs TURN server allowed relaying of TCP connections and UDP packets to internal Slack network and meta-data services on AWS.
      Accessing to that meta-data services usually allow you to get the IAM credential of that instance profile.

    description: |
      Having a good database schema design is crucial for building applications that will need to scale in traffic and complexity. 
      If you happen to do a bad design choice you will see that it takes a lot of effort to stop the pattern from propagating to your backends‚Äô services and controllers, and finally to your frontend

      Postgres is great and it has so many options to tune its performance. New article pop up time to time.
      There are four high-level settings which will be discussed here: shared_buffers,  wal_buffers,  effective_cache_size, and maintenance_work_mem.

    description: |
      Expensify has an unusual technology stack in many way. No internal dns, just managed /etc/host, but most surprising is that they don‚Äôt use MySQL or Postgres ‚Äî instead using none other than SQLite ‚Äî and it works great. They wrap SQLite in [bedrockdb](https://bedrockdb.com/), even using it for their job queue.

    description: |
      Diagnosing network problems is something that system administrators dread. Almost always their inability to perform efficient network analysis is based on their own reluctance to learn and embrace network testing. Let‚Äôs change that by learning three tools that a system admin should routinely use: mtr, iperf, and MTU testing with ping.

Buffer Overflow bugs from user-input can often allow someone to overwrite some data in memory they weren't supposed to. Before we dive into how to exploit Buffer Overflow bugs, we will do a quick introduction to Assembly."

      It is suprising easy to do that in 2020. Plus you got to lear what component we need for mail server.
