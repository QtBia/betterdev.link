  Hi everyone,

  Welcome to issue #149. I got quite a bit of stuff, code and tooling. Lot of fun thing like tool to write books, podcast cli.  I also included more videos link than normal, since we're having more time during this pandemic.

  If you are a person who enjoy online video lessions, you may check out [Free Online Courses from hardvard](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/catalog/free). They have lot of stuff, from computer science to physis to math.

    description: |
      TCP is supposed to guarantee that all bytes sent by one endpoint of a connection will be received, in the same order, by the other endpoint. In this article weâ€™ll identify and demonstrate a wrinkle in the Linux implementation of TCP SYN cookies. The client can connect and send two packets, but the serverâ€™s TCP stack delivers the data in the second packet to the application, unaware that it is not the first packet in the stream.

      DNS is a globally distributed hierarchical database that maps domain names to Internet hosts throughout the world. It evolve using a single HOSTS.txt file to map domain to ip address.
