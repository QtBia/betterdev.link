      Certificates and public key infrastructure (PKI) are hard.
      Do you know what is X509, P12, PEM, PKCS and all other TLS acronyms. I don't and I tried to ask it in many
      interviews I had. No one knows. So let's read this, and master PKI.

      We all use VM. Docker for Mac run on a VM too. What if we write our own virtuam machine? How hard that is.
      It helps us gain a deeper understanding of what is going on inside a computer and better understand how programming languages work

      Clearly your best hope is to refactor the function by decomposing it into smaller one.
      Strategies for breaking up functions: closures, loop and deal with long parameter lists,
      sequential coupling, extract computation, complex if, polymorphism.

    description: |
      Main issue is because how C++ handle errors with exception, which the author think create
      undefined behaviour. It's good to read about the use of exceptions which we get too familiar
      in every language like Java, Python, Ruby, JavaScript.

      I never think about header bloat? who is going to add KBs into header? Well, HTTP2 does
      add a form of header compression (called HPACK) to help address this concern.

      As of 2018, almost 90% of the 74,000 developers surveyed by Stack Overflow prefer to use Git for version control. Git dominates all other version control systems and adoption is up almost 20% from 2017 according to the survey. However, Git has not always been this ubiquitous. Let’s take a look at its ascent into mass popularity.

    description: |
      Instead of building custom API endpoint for every page, Netflix opted for GraphQL as the middle layer of the app.
      Not only did adding GraphQL solve the network bandwidth bottleneck, but it also provided numerous enefits that helped them add features more quickly.
