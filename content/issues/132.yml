      Use enums instead.
      With any blanket statements like this, there are always exceptions. Though in general, I believe the use of enums is often a better choice compared to boolean, unless you really need to squeeze your data into one single physical bit.

    title: Sequential UUID Generators
    description: |
      UUIDs are a popular identifier data type – they are unpredictable, and/or globally unique (or at least very unlikely to collide) and quite easy to generate.
      UUIDs make the access patterns much more random compared to traditional sequential identifiers, cause WAL write amplification etc. So let’s look at an extension generating “sequential” UUIDs, and how it can reduce the negative consequences of using UUIDs
