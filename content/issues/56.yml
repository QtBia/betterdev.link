    description: |
      The ptrace(2) system call is usually associated with debugging. It’s the primary mechanism through which native debuggers monitor debuggees on unix-like systems. It’s also the usual approach for implementing strace — system call trace. With Ptrace, tracers can pause tracees, inspect and set registers and memory, monitor system calls, or even intercept system calls.
