      MySQL is still used in primary-secondary setup. To update primary, we have to pause write. Pausing data modifications causes downtime, and this amount of downtime must be minimized to the shortest amount possible. This post details how Yelp has integrated open-source tools to provide advanced MySQL failure detection and execute automated recoveries to minimize the downtime of our read-write MySQL traffic.

    description: |
      Almost any large scale system will need some kind of job queue or async task. Dropbox designed a system that can handle 10,000 async tasks per second from the start, and be architected for future growth. This system is used among 28 teams. They documented Dropbox ATF thoroughly, as a reference and guide for the engineering community seeking their own async solutions.
