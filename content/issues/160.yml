    description: "Linux has an amazing yet frustrated at the same time about display. Xorg, Xserver, X11, KDE, Gnome, Xfce...The full dekstop environment can easily swap out. That multitude can be overwhelming or confusing when we don't have the full picture. There are multiple documentations for each side of the Linux's display system, but globally how does it work exactly?"

      Your phone is a mini computer with low power consumtion, and if you add the SIM, it maybe come a great device to be always online. What if we run a web server on that device and open it to the internet.
      What kind of programming language will be easily to be deploy and run on the phone.

      Key exchange is fundamental in any secure connection, at some point it will have a key exchange that only two partners know so no one can see what they are communicate.
      This post is an attempt to explain this process in a simpler way.

      Cloudflate TV is like a TV show where you tune in to watch their engineers talk about programming. Cloudflare has great blog posts we link many time in the past too.
      They want a solution as simple as joining a Zoom call. They laid out technical challens when building an infrastructur for that.

      This is probably a post for mobile dev. However, most of time the one who setup build/release for a mobile app maybe a devops/backend engineer. Therefore, understanding
      code signing process on iOS is really important. Even if you don't have to deal with this at all, it's still a good read to understand how iOS control this process.

    description: |
      SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) is an instruction set available mostly on all current processors. SIMD instructions give data-level parallelism on a unit (vector of data). A single instruction is executed in parallel on multiple data points as opposed to executing multiple instructions. That improves the performance. People use SIMD to [parse JSON faster](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson) or process image. In this post, we learn about 3 use cases to make use of SIMD for great peformance

      Understanding the fundamental building blocks(ðŸ˜‰) of Bitcoin can be daunting for some developers. I find it difficult to meaningfully understand a system without knowing how everything fits together. Someone on Hacker News also wrote a [toy implementation of the Bitcoin algorithm](https://github.com/tlrobinson/tomcoin/blob/master/src/node.js) in Node so you can even test mining in browser.

    description: |
      Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are an increasingly popular family of algorithms for optimistic replication. They allow data to be concurrently updated on several replicas, even while those replicas are offline, and provide a robust way of merging those updates back into a consistent state. CRDTs are used in geo-replicated databases, multi-user collaboration software, distributed processing frameworks, and various other systems.
