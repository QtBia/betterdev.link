description: " Hi everyone, Welcome to issue #153. This week, I found a [free course on Network Security](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/computing-and-ict/systems-computer/network-security/content-section-0?intro=1), on OpenLearn. It's a short course and part 5) Implementing encryption in networks, looks pretty good."

      Amazing project. Use notepad as a ASCII display to render and play animation of an object to do ray tracing.
      One of cool thing is it search memory of a process, find a pattern to find the memory address that hold NotePad display text, and change it constantly to simulate re-rendering.

      Troubleshooting is both a science and an art. The first step is to make a hypothesis about why something is behaving in an unexpected way, and then prove whether or not the hypothesis is correct.
      If the issue is too vague, then you need to brainstorm in order to narrow down the problem‚Äîthis is where the ‚Äúartistic‚Äù part of the process comes in.

      Prometheus is a monitoring and alerting system. It is very different from traditional system alerting where it scrape metric instead of you writing metric to it.
      When scraping, the data is pre-aggreated, so the way to query it is more about trending than individual event. Being different, it has a high learning curve.
