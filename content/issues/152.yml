    description: |
      Usually, you are not directly connected to the internet, but you are part of a local smaller network, called Ethernet. Signal sent through this network can be read
      by all clients connected to same network. Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange provides a way of generating a shared key between two people in such a way that the key cannot be seen by observing the communication.

    title: "The CPU Cost of Networking on a Host"
    description: |
      When evaluating networking for a host the focus is typically on latency, throughput or packets per second (pps) to see the maximum load a system can handle for a given configuration.
      While those are important and often telling metrics, results for such benchmarks do not tell you the impact processing those packets has on the workloads running on that system.

    description: |
      KVM is a virtualization technology that comes with the Linux kernel. KVM provides an API via a special device node - /dev/kvm. By opening a device you obtain a handle to the KVM subsystem and later make ioctl syscalls to allocate resources and launch VMs.
