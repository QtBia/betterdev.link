  Hi all, many readers write in to ask for more languages in code to read section. I code primarily in
  Go, Ruby and Elixir so I have go extra efforts to cover other languages. If you know good code to read,
  please suggest by email me. Thank you Divyanshu Singh for letting me know about a bug on the site.

      This is a hack challenge where the IAM run the lambda function has write access to S3 bucket of
      static side so they can be hack and overwrite S3 bucket.
      Try to run as much as thing in read only mode so even in those case, the damage is minimal.

      A line of code you write in a codebase under active development may be read tens, hundreds or thousands of times. This line is likely to be adapted, moved and copied multiple times. How should we optimize for this reality of a living codebase?

    description: |
      Optional types, functional transformations, and immutability can all help to write better JavaScript. When pulling these ideas together, however, they come with severe trade-offs, work together poorly, and ultimately fail in the goal of effectively transferring trust from developers to code and tools.
