  Hi everyone! 👋

  Due to a bug in my code, I accidently sent out email with `[TEST]` in the subject. The `[TEST]` email
  are the one I send to myself before fanning out to make sure email look good. But due to a bug, it is send
  to a small subset of user as well.

  I am really sorry for that and hope you are not upset with duplicate email this week. I will try to be more careful next time
  and implement some other method to prevent that happen.

  Welcome to issue #142. This is a fun and practical issue: guide to common unix toolbox, help you
  get along with Linux, how to migrate from AWS to Google, some challenges on designing game for
  internet play.

  Let me know if you like this issue, if it is too much or too few.

      I don't think I will use this in a production site. But it's a very interesting approach to trim down font.
      Basically, it rendered the site, looks for which character the sites are using, and strip the characters
      the size aren't use from the font. You need to crawl entire sites for that so again, not well suite for production
      workload but a very interesting approach. I didn't even know we can strip fonts like that.

    title: "Have An Eye On Locks Of PostgreSQL"
    description: |
      The lock is an essential part of a database system. In PostgreSQL, there are various locks, such as table lock, row lock, page lock, transaction lock, advisory lock, etc. Some of these locks are automatically added to complete the database functions during the operation of the database system, and some are manually added for the elements in PostgreSQL through some SQL commands.

    description: |
      There is often some confusion about NULL value, as it is treated differently in different languages. So there is an obvious need to clarify what NULL is, how it works in different languages, and what the actual value is behind the NULL.

      I've known about Bloom filters (named after Burton Bloom) since university, but I haven't had an opportunity to use them in anger. Last month this changed - I became fascinated with the promise of this data structure, but I quickly realized it had some drawbacks. This blog post is the tale of my brief love affair with Bloom filters.

      Designing first-person action games for Internet play is a challenging process. Having robust on-line gameplay in your action title, however, is becoming essential to the success and longevity of the title. In addition, the PC space is well known for requiring developers to support a wide variety of customer setups. Often, customers are running on less than state-of-the-art hardware. The same holds true for their network connection
