      This is free online version of a book. The [full pdf version](http://webdam.inria.fr/Alice/pdfs/all.pdf) is also available.
      It's a theory heavy book, not like  a simple "How to" google query.
      Other book in this category is [reading in database system](http://www.redbook.io/) which we also linked to before, but want to remind here.
