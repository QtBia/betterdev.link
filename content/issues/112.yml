  In last weeks, many issues about application that exposing a local web servers without authentication. Therefore a random JavaScript code on any website can interact with it in way that avoid CORS. Some evens listen on `0.0.0.0` so any one in LAN can also `curl` it. The main problem is those are unauthenticated API. So this week we have many links about security: encyrpting, signing.

      Encrypting data is all about making sure that only the right people can view the data you’ve encrypted. There are two primary forms of data encryption: symmetric and asymmetric. The hardest thing about encrypting data isn’t encryption, it’s key management.

      If Bluetooth is ON on your Apple device everyone nearby can understand current status of your device, get info about battery, device name, Wi-Fi status, buffer availability, OS version and even get your mobile phone number.
      The code to demo this is 100% open source so you will be able to learn about bluetooth and decode data transferting too. Pretty cool I must say.

        We investigate how to find process listen on port, disassembly it, run it with a debugger set breakpoints right before the decryption calls, and   read the encryption key and IV from memory. I learn a lot from it.
