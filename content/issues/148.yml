  Hi everyone,

  Welcome to issue #148. I got quite a bit of stuff, code and tooling. Lot of fun thing like tool to write books, podcast cli.  I also included more videos link than normal, since we're having more time during this pandemic.

  If you are a person who enjoy online video lessions, you may check out [Free Online Courses from hardvard](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/catalog/free). They have lot of stuff, from computer science to physis to math.

    title: "DIY Single Sign-On for SSH"
    description: |
      We are going to set up Google single sign-on for SSH. Behind the scenes, we'll use OpenID Connect (OIDC), short-lived SSH certificates, a couple of clever SSH configuration tweaks, and Smallstep's open-source step-ca and step packages. We will set up an SSH Certificate Authority, and use it to bootstrap a new host and a new user in our system. While this approach requires more up-front work than a typical SSH public/private key setup, it comes with a lot of benefits beyond single sign-on. It eliminates the need for gathering and shipping and managing authorized_keys files.

      You are in desperate need of a detailed yet concise overview of how real companies do this. How do they store their data? How do their different applications talk to each other? How do they scale their systems to work for millions of users? How do they keep them secure? How do they make sure nothing goes wrong? What are APIs, webhooks and client libraries, when you really get down to it?

      We are going to see ready-to-use libraries and tools to parse SQL, and an example project in which we will build our own SQL parser.
      Another article about parsing SQL is [Database basics: binary expressions and WHERE filters](https://notes.eatonphil.com/database-basics-expressions-and-where.html). We linked to this article before where the author is writing a SQL database from scratch in Go.
      And if you want more fun on query compiler, check [SELECT wat FROM sql](https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/select-wat-from-sql/).

      This is a story about refactoring. It's the third item in the TDD red-green-refactor cycle[1] and it's the thing we do all the time, right? Except when we don't.
      I have an unruly code base which has suffered from refactoring neglect, so I've been bringing it back into line. In this article I will take a class that is too large, and make it smaller.

    description: |
      The use of mocks in unit testing is a controversial topic (maybe less so now than several years ago). I remember how, throughout my programming career, I went from mocking almost every dependency, to the "no-mocks" policy, and then to "only mock external dependencies".

      gitops are a strategy in DevOps when we store all the configuration into Git repository and re-popolate it from there. So then we can code review
      infrastructure change. Imagine instead of creating a deployment, you write the revision into a file in your repo, commit and the change will be applied to your cluster       through some tools that listen for github change and apply to your environment
