  Hi all, I'm trimming down the news letter so we only have really good links. But to not disappointed programmers
  who starve for information, I started [BetterDev telegram channel](https://t.me/betterdev) which you can join to get more update.

    title: "Testing in Production, the safe way"
    description: |
      Many company tests in a dedicated QA/Staging environment. Yet, bug is still catch on production.
      The problem is some are impossible to catch on a non-production env. Because essentially we don't
      test on the environment we run. So how we can make test in production safety without corrupted data,
      or interrupt workload of any existing application.

    description: |
      Type inference is a major feature of several programming languages, most notably languages from the ML family like Haskell.
      We will learn Hindley-Milner algorithm and use it to impelemtn a simple Python implementation for a toy ML-like language.

    description: |
      Recursion schemes is a magnificent example of how category-theoretical concepts can bring both rigor and simplicity to day-to-day programming tasks. No matter the structures in question—lists, directory hierarchies, control flow graphs, database records—recursion schemes bring us an orderly and predictable way to traverse them.
