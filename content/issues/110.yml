  This week I was doing some load testing and need to bump up some linux kernel parameter to ensure our load testing machine can generate as much as traffic possible.

  Here is my tip on what to set if you ever need it:

  ```
  sysctl -w fs.file-max=1000000
  sysctl -w fs.nr_open=1000000
  ulimit -n 1000000
  sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_mem='10000000 10000000 10000000'
  sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem='1024 4096 16384'
  sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem='1024 4096 16384'
  sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=16384
  sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=16384
  ```

       DataDog operates 40+ Kafka and ZooKeeper clusters that process trillions of datapoints across multiple infrastructure platforms, data centers, and regions every day. In this post, we‚Äôd like to share some of these lessons learned and highlight the metrics and logs that can help you keep tabs on the issues we encountered.

      The thought experiment ‚ÄúImagine if this were possible‚Äù is helpful in thinking through whether Windows lets you do something or other. (A special case of this is ‚ÄúWhen people ask for security holes as features.‚Äù) If the possibility leads to an obvious contradiction or the violation of generally-accepted rules of metaphysics, then you can be pretty sure that Windows doesn‚Äôt support it.
