    title: "How I use Wireshark"
    description: |
      Wireshark is a really powerful and complicated tool, but in practice I only know how to do a very small number of things with it, and those things are really useful!

    description: |
      Go code can be statically linked, and so requires no installed libraries. How about VM?
      Could you have a VM thatâ€™s just a linux kernel and your Go binary? I suspect it is not

      components.
