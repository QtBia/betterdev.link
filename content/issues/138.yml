  Hi everyone, ! ðŸ‘‹

  Welcome to issue #138. Big week for security, Cisco and Sudo boths has Vulnerabilities.

  If you has been playing around with Lambda and still not sure how the world view it, then this blog post from datadog will convince you.
  Basically [half of of AWS users have adopted Lambda](https://www.datadoghq.com/state-of-serverless/).

  Now to our normal links. If you have developer friends, please share this newsletter with them :-). Thank you.

      [The technical whitepapers](https://go.armis.com/hubfs/White-papers/Armis-CDPwn-WP.pdf) are 29 pages long has all detail and code(by decompile code).
      Reading these white papers are definetely improve your knowledge a lot and help to avoid these mistake: mostly on stack overflow and format-string vulnerability.
