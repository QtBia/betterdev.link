  Kubernetes is going big right now, every day I saw a new K8S article. I run
  k8s for betterdev.link too :D. We're a static site but recently add some
  dynamic features. I think as a programmer, we should spend sometime to learn
  K8S because it isn't that hard. I includes some interesting k8s article in
  this issue. Hope you like them!

      I used to think that the only way to be a great developer was to work
      myself sick. My health, friendships, and family all suffered because of

      saved me.

    description: |
      When it comes to release software? The debate of branch comes up? Git flow
      or trunk base? I myself agree with the author of not branching. The post
      has strong opinion and you may not agree with it but it's another angle
      of development shared from somone who are successful with that method.

      Looking into CVE improves lot of knowledge on how something works, how

      When running `kubectl exec` we can run `/bin/bash` to attach shell. Feel
      like SSH but it is actually a websocket connetion. We'll look into the
      low level protocol to understand its mechanism.
