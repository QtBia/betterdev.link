    description: |
      Physics engines are responsible for figuring out where each object in a scene is over time. Objects can collide with one another, then choose to respond in several ways. It’s a generic problem that the user can configure at several different levels. Do they want a collider? Do they want to respond to collisions? Do they want to simulate dynamics? They could want dynamics, but not gravity. It’s a problem that calls for good planning and robust design.

#      Writing DNS server is like hello world for networking to me. DNS is small enough, not massive like HTTP, also relying on UDP, so I think it's a good exercise to learn UDP, DNS protocol.
