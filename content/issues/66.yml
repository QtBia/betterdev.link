  This issue may a bit Go heavy because the GopherConf just finished. I have pick some of topics
  that I think will boost your knowledge regardless you are writing Go or not.

    title: "Select Star SQL"
    description: |
      This is an interactive book which aims to be the best place on the internet for learning SQL. It is free of charge, free of ads and doesn't require registration or downloads. It helps you learn by running queries against a real-world dataset to complete projects of consequence. It is not a mere reference page — it conveys a mental model for writing SQL.

    title: "Repeat yourself, do more than one thing, and rewrite everything"
    description: |
      Following “Don’t Repeat Yourself” might lead you to a function with four boolean flags, and a matrix of behaviours to carefully navigate when changing the code. Splitting things up into simple units can lead to awkward composition and struggling to coordinate cross cutting changes. Avoiding rewrites means they’re often left so late that they have no chance of succeeding.

    description: |
      I'm a big fan of big company sharing their infrastructure design. This is kind of a retrospective among Zendesk's VP
      of engineering, CTO and their co-founder and why they settle on Rails at the beginning.

    description: |
      Seccomp is a feature provided by the Linux kernel and is used to control the syscalls made by a process. Seccomp has been implemented by numerous projects such as Docker, Android, OpenSSH and Firefox. In this blog post, I am going to show you how you can implement your own seccomp filters, at runtime, for a Go binary on your Dyno.

      A comprehensive evaluation of third-party cookie policies. Testing across 7 browsers and 46 browser extensions, the authors find that for virtually every browser and extension combination there is a way to bypass the defense mechanisms built into browsers that seek to protect against user tracking and cross-site attacks.
