    title: "How to implement strings"
    description: |

    title: "Indirection Is Not Abstraction"
    description: |
      The concept of abstraction in software development is frequently misunderstood and confused with indirection. This is partially because of the keywords abstract and interface in statically-typed languages such as Java and C#. The confusion often leads to design changes that leave the code worse than before it was touched. Let’s look at how abstraction and indirection relate, and how to correctly connect components.

    description: |
      Red errors are important; they make it easy to discern exceptions from standard output. Surprisingly, colorizing stderr is not as straightforward as it sounds and this is the story of racing pipes, file descriptor hacking, and libc monkey-patching.
