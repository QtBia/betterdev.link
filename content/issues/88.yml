draft: false

description: |
  Mandrill had a big outage last last week due to [Postgres Transaction ID Wraparound and vacuum](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19086626).
  Sentry got hit with the [same issue and document it](https://blog.sentry.io/2015/07/23/transaction-id-wraparound-in-postgres.html) in 2015.
  Make sure you aware of these issue and tune your auto vacuum to prevent this issue if you are using Postgres at scale.

      Thereâ€™s a trade off involved in optimizing software. The cost of better performance is the opportunity cost of the time that it took to write the optimization, and the additional cost of maintenance for code that becomes more complex and more difficult to understand.

      Event sourcing is sell as solution for everything. By keep a history of all event happen to your application.
      You can re-construct state of your data at anytime. Chris tells us its drawback. I like this one most: what happen if you change the
      logic/structure so now the code cannot handle old events anymore?
