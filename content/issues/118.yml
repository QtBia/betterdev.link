  This week I want to share a useful `git diff` flag.
  Have you ever want to quickly run your lint/test only on changed
  file between the stable branch and your feature branch?

  It has a very simple command for that:

  ```
  git --no-pager diff --name-only develop
  ```

  Then you can pipe these into your test cli or linter:

  ```
  git --no-pager diff --name-only develop | xargs -I file rubocop file
  ```

  Now to our links.
