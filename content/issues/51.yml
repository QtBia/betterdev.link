      There are several types of locks but, the important thing about them, is how they interact with each other. Because two transactions cannot hold locks of conflicting modes on the same object at the same time. And a non minor detail, once acquired, a lock is normally held till end of transaction.

      Elm syntax doesn't look like JavaScript so it has a learning curve. In fact, Elm is smaller and simpler than JavaScript, and it shouldn't take longer than 8 hours to go through all this documentation, including doing some exercises. I belive it's a good investment, plus it's fun.
