      I like how the author approach memory leak debugging: ask question, form a hypothesis, analyze hypothesis and repeat

      I wanted to better understand how hash functions work, and the best way to learn is to do. For years Iâ€™d been treating them like magic, shoving input into it and seeing random-looking, but deterministic, output come out the other end.

      SAT is the problem of deciding whether a formula in boolean logic is satisfiable. What makes SAT interesting is that a variant of it was the first problem to be proven NP-complete.
